# Informations on environement
the global crontab is the root crontab file.
the crontab user manual says about the working files :
>Each user can have their own crontab, and though
these are files in `/var/spool/cron/crontabs`, they are not
intended to be edited directly.

these files are considered "internal" to the system and may not be changed to avoid problems like data lost etc ...
