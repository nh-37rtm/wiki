# Snap
You can tell .. snap is yet another packaging tool. but i think it add some interesting feature like isolating execution, decomposition with groups of low level access features called ``interfaces`` for exemple :
- account-control
- audio-record
- docker

you can compare this to the android applications fonctionnalities wich i think aim the security issues. it's also an ease of use for the application developper/packager, and it forces the packager to be aware of the software features ... the packager box is smaller and reduce the zone of a potential side effect.

Snap is compatible with some others linux distribs
